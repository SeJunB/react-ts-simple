## react-ts-hello-world

## Motivation
Are you tired of having to delete all the default markup/files after running `create-vite` ? Well, look no further. This `react-ts-hello-world` creates a React Application with the minimal amount of markups. Perfect for when you want to spin up a react project for a tutorial.

I created this npx tool, because I got tired of deleting all the default files and markups  when you run `create-react-app` or `create-vite`.

## About
This npx tool creates a very simple React Application that has only one file.

## react-ts-simple

## Motivation
Are you tired of having to delete all the default markup/files after running `create-vite` ? Well, look no further. The [react-ts-simple package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ts-simple) creates a React Application with the minimal amount of markups. Perfect for when you want to spin up a react project for a tutorial.

I created this npm package, because I got tired of deleting all the default files and markups after running `create-vite`.

To use this npm package, execute the command
```
npm react-ts-simple create
```
